/*
    Program Descriptor: Write a program that uses a 3x2 array. Your program must do the following:

                        a) Enter in values for each element in the array.
                        b) Calculate and display the sum of row 0, row 1, and row 2 separately.
                        c) Calculate and display the sum of column 0 and column 1 separately.
                        d) Find the highest number in the array and display it.

                        NOTE: You might try to design the solution for this program on paper first. Do not
                        hack code to solve this question
